# ✈️ Threat Intelligence Using MITRE ATT&CK® for the Aviation Sector *(Hypothetical Scenario)*

## 🧠 Overview
This project was created as part of a **hypothetical threat intelligence (TI) exercise** to simulate the role of a Security Analyst working in the aviation sector. The scenario assumes a fictional organization transitioning to cloud infrastructure, with the objective of using the MITRE ATT&CK® framework to identify relevant APT groups and evaluate their techniques, tools, affected platforms, and mitigations.

## 🎯 Objective
Use MITRE ATT&CK® to gather **actionable cyber threat intelligence** by:
- Identifying an APT group targeting the aviation sector (active since at least 2013)
- Investigating cloud-relevant TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)
- Exploring associated tools, affected platforms, and potential mitigations
- Highlighting any gaps in defensive coverage

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources
- [MITRE ATT&CK® Navigator](https://attack.mitre.org/)
- MITRE Threat Group and Technique documentation
- Public OSINT sources

## 📌 Scenario Summary
> You are a Security Analyst at a fictional aviation organization migrating to the cloud. Your task is to leverage MITRE ATT&CK® to research APT groups who pose a threat to your sector and ensure that cloud-specific attack techniques and defenses are considered.

## 🔍 Investigation Steps & Findings

### 1. 🕵️‍♂️ What is a group that targets your sector who has been in operation since at least 2013?
- **APT33**  
  APT33 is a suspected Iranian threat group that has carried out operations since at least 2013. The group has targeted organizations across multiple industries in the United States, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea, with a particular interest in the aviation and energy sectors

### 2. ☁️ As your organization is migrating to the cloud, is there anything attributed to this APT group that you should focus on?
- **Yes** — APT28 is known to use the technique **Valid Accounts (T1078)** to maintain persistence in cloud environments.

### 3. 🧰 What tool is associated with the technique from the previous question?
- **Mimikatz** — Used for credential dumping to gain access via valid accounts.

### 4. 🛡️ Referring to the technique from question 2, what mitigation method suggests using SMS messages as an alternative?
- **Multi-factor Authentication (M1032)** — Recommends using out-of-band factors like **SMS-based one-time passcodes**.

### 5. 💻 What platforms does the technique from question #2 affect?
- **Affected Platforms:**  
  `Windows`, `Linux`, `macOS`, `Azure AD`, `Office 365`, `Google Workspace`, `SaaS`, `IaaS`, `Network`

## 📈 Outcome
- Practiced using MITRE ATT&CK® to perform threat group profiling
- Mapped real-world adversary behaviors to tools and mitigations
- Highlighted how CTI can inform cloud migration defense strategies
- Strengthened understanding of attacker persistence techniques and MFA requirements

---

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to derive operational value from open-source threat intelligence
- How to align MITRE ATT&CK® techniques with evolving infrastructure needs (e.g. cloud)
- The importance of multi-layered authentication as a defensive control

---

## 💼 Use Cases
- Creating threat-informed defense strategies for specific industries
- Educating teams on attacker behaviors and risk areas
- Building CTI workflows into cloud security planning
