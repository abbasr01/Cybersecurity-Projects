## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Abbas Raza — an ex-investment banking analyst turned aspiring cybersecurity professional. After leaving behind the finance world, I dove headfirst into cybersecurity and haven’t looked back since. I’m currently focused on building a strong foundation in both offensive and defensive security practices, with the long-term goal of contributing meaningfully to the field while maintaining the freedom to live life on my own terms.

## 🧠 Skills & Tools Used Across Projects

Throughout the projects in this repository, I’ve gained hands-on experience with a wide range of tools, technologies, and techniques that span offensive, defensive, and analytical aspects of cybersecurity. Here's a breakdown of what I’ve worked with:

---

### 🛡️ Blue Team & Defensive Security

- **Log Analysis & Monitoring**:  
  - Windows Event Viewer, Sysmon, Log Parser Studio  
  - ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)  
  - Sigma rules and basic log correlation  
- **Network Traffic Analysis**:  
  - Wireshark, Tcpdump  
  - PCAP parsing and filtering (http, dns, smb, ftp)

### ⚙️ Scripting & Automation

- **Python**:  
  - Custom scripts for scanning, parsing logs, automating tasks  
  - Working with libraries like `socket`, `os`, `subprocess`, and `requests`  
- **Bash & PowerShell**:  
  - Command-line automation for enumeration and system configuration  
  - Scheduled tasks, registry modifications, system info gathering

### 🖥️ Lab Infrastructure & Virtualization

- **Operating Systems**:  
  - Kali Linux, Parrot OS, Ubuntu, Windows 10/11/Server  
- **Virtualization Platforms**:  
  - VirtualBox, VMware Workstation  
  - Simulated enterprise labs with multiple VMs and attacker/defender roles  
- **Networking Tools**:  
  - Netcat, Wireshark, OpenVPN  
  - Static IP configuration, SSH tunneling, NAT vs Bridged network setups

### 📚 Soft Skills & Mindset

- **Analytical Thinking**:  
  - Root cause analysis of complex issues  
  - Pattern recognition across incidents and logs  
- **Documentation**:  
  - Detailed walkthroughs and writeups  
  - Effective use of Markdown, screenshots, and in-line explanations  
- **Time Management**:  
  - Consistently managing learning, certification prep, and practical labs  
- **Self-Learning**:  
  - Curiosity-driven research and adaptation
